## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later** - [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- **MySQL Database Server** - [Download here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
- **Java IDE** (such as IntelliJ, Eclipse, or NetBeans)

---

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BankManagementSystem.git
   cd BankManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Set Up JDK**

   - Install the JDK following the instructions on the Oracle website.
   - Configure the JDK path in your IDE:
     - In **IntelliJ IDEA**: Go to `File > Project Structure > Project SDK` and set it to your JDK location.
     - In **Eclipse**: Go to `Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs` and add the JDK location if needed.

3. **Open Project in IDE**

   - Open the project folder in your chosen IDE.

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Install and Configure MySQL

- Download and install MySQL from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
- Set up a root user with a secure password.
- Open the MySQL command line or use a GUI like **MySQL Workbench**.

### Step 2: Create the Database and Tables

1. **Login to MySQL**:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. **Run the SQL Commands to Create Database and Tables**:




### Step 3: Update Database Credentials

- In the `src/utils/DatabaseConnection.java` file, update the database credentials with your MySQL username and password.

  ```java
  private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/LearningDB";
  private static final String USER = "your_mysql_username";
  private static final String PASSWORD = "your_mysql_password";
  ```

## Future Improvements

This project is designed for learning and demonstration. Here are some suggested improvements which can be applied in the future:

- Add more functionalities for every user.
- Implement more sophisticated error handling.
- Create a user interface (UI) for easier interaction.
- Expand the database to support additional details.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure your MySQL server is running, and check your credentials in `DatabaseConnection.java`.
- **Class Not Found Errors**: Confirm that your JDK is correctly set up in your IDE.
- **SQL Errors**: Double-check your SQL syntax and ensure the database schema matches the code.
