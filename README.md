## Database Setup

### Step 1: Install and Configure MySQL

- Download and install MySQL from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
- Set up a root user with a secure password.
- Open the MySQL command line or use a GUI like **MySQL Workbench**.

### Step 2: Create the Database and Tables

1. **Login to MySQL**:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. **Run the SQL Commands to Create Database and Tables**:








- **User Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete user accounts.
- **Course Management**: Instructors can easily create and manage their courses.
- **Enrollment Management**: Students can enroll in available courses.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple navigation and minimal design to avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Target Users
- **Administrators**: Manage users and oversee system operations.
- **Instructors**: Create and manage courses.
- **Students**: Enroll in and track their courses.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Java with JDBC (Java Database Connector) for MySQL integration
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code (IDE), Git (Version Control)

## Current Status
The initial development includes:
- **Login Page Prototype**: Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a foundational framework, stored in the projectâ€™s GitHub repository.
- **Database Setup**: MySQL database setup has been initiated.
- **Site Flowchart**: A functional flowchart outlines the site's navigation for each user type (Admin, Instructor, Student).

## Future Plans
We plan to expand the system with additional features based on user feedback and project requirements. These may include enhanced course management tools, performance tracking, and expanded user settings.
