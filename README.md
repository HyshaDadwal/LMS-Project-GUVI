# LMS-Project-GUVI
Repository for the Online LMS Project for GUVI in semester 3

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a streamlined, user-friendly Online Learning Management System (LMS) tailored to the needs of small institutions and individual instructors. Unlike many existing LMS platforms that tend to be overly complex, this LMS focuses on essential features, providing a simplified experience for administrators, instructors, and students.

## Problem Statement
Existing LMS solutions often have excessive features that make them difficult to navigate, especially for smaller institutions. This LMS is designed to be straightforward and accessible, with a primary focus on user management, course management, and easy enrollment.

## Solution
Our LMS addresses this challenge by offering only core functionalities within a simple, text-based interface. This approach minimizes the learning curve and enhances usability for all types of users, ensuring a seamless experience in managing courses and enrollments.

## Key Features
- **User Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete user accounts.
- **Course Management**: Instructors can easily create and manage their courses.
- **Enrollment Management**: Students can enroll in available courses.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple navigation and minimal design to avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Target Users
- **Administrators**: Manage users and oversee system operations.
- **Instructors**: Create and manage courses.
- **Students**: Enroll in and track their courses.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Java with JDBC (Java Database Connector) for MySQL integration
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code (IDE), Git (Version Control)

## Current Status
The initial development includes:
- **Login Page Prototype**: Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a foundational framework, stored in the projectâ€™s GitHub repository.
- **Database Setup**: MySQL database setup has been initiated.
- **Site Flowchart**: A functional flowchart outlines the site's navigation for each user type (Admin, Instructor, Student).

## Future Plans
We plan to expand the system with additional features based on user feedback and project requirements. These may include enhanced course management tools, performance tracking, and expanded user settings.
